# \#dgov Values

The Why?

Below are all the values we identify:

Truth

Immunity

Sovereignty

Functionality

Highly-adaptable

Anti-fragility

Cohesion

Rapture 

Coherence

Humility 

Collaboration

Inclusion

Competence

Trust

We developed two basic types of values - some were human centric, the others were systematical.

</table>Distribution and decentralisation - you can see these systems in nature as well, hierarchies can be seen everywhere and should not be rejected per se. 

Chris: the end system will look like a hierarchy. We’re talking about distribution but these systems are nested in each other, overlapping constantly. The governance as distribution of power is all about how the overlapping functions, what are the patterns we can identify to achieve the values. 

Why distributed governance? Less captured then centred. 

**Value review and recaption**

Eliminating the ones we don’t feel fit so a strong core remains. 

There’s a lot of cohesion between the values and we might separate them a bit so we make a systematic pattern. 

We need to find out the minimal structure, minimal viable systems and minimal viable structure is that we need for the system to evolve. 

We already have some patterns - on one hand we have those that we all know and we need to find how we’re going to combine them, while on the other hand we have values that we don’t commonly recognise and need to start with the common understanding of them. 

When we have different cultural backgrounds it is difficult to kick start as a DAO, we do need a cohesion around the values. In every human based system there is a value story and a structure for governing how we rule. If we speak about ‘’code as a law’’ there is a bias perception. 

If we’re focusing on a structure there might be a danger lingering upon this that we forget why we’re doing it. 

Last 5 minutes: reading the questions and reflecting upon. 

We’re being capable of going from complexity while we can still open to some specific issues we need to address is something we need to take into consideration. It’s revealing for those who can contribute more with the knowledge they possess in other fields.
