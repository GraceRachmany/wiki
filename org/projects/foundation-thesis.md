# \#dgov movement manifesto

Goal: define a manifesto, which will guide the movement, community and org development.

## Questions to be answered

* What are we trying to accomplish
* Why are we doing this?
* Is it a movement or a consortia \(see movement definition below, compared to platform coop consortia\)
  * If a movement – what change are we looking for?
  * If a movement is tech then secondary?
* What is the connection of \#dgov with the technology, blockchain, scaleable governance, governance automation?
* Is \#dgov specific for networks/platforms/coops? 
* How is it compared with other networks like [responsive.org](https://www.responsive.org/) or P2P Foundation?
* What are out guiding principles?

### Defining the movement

* ultimate goal the group intends to achieve. When a movement achieves success—“Mission accomplished!”—everyone goes home. 
* Global
* sweeping change \(over incremental improvement\)
* Movements begin with values
* Then + strategy, and direct action
* on values: set priority e.g. cooperation over self interest

## Prev attempts

### From Anja

Dgov is short for distributed governance. It’s a movement created by a group of people concerned with the on-chain and off-chain governance of distributed ledger technologies \(DLT\) which can execute orders via smart contracts and help our broad society to improve with references to transactions, communication and social interactions. The systems build with DLT protocols can be captured by actors such as powerful individuals, influential groups, governments and states. In order to avoid capturing and empowering monopolies, DGov explores ways of distribution, governance systems, value prepositions and needs of contemporary society to build anti-fragile, human-centric and purpose driven designs.

We aim to do so with building a distributed autonomous organization \(DAO\) which will be agnostic to some extend and allow bridges with other DAOs and between various DLTs to build layers of applications \(DApps\) we can use in our daily lives without even acknowledging their existence, yet live much better as the utilization of digitally transmitted data allows us to become fulfilled and content bulbs of particles in this space and time.

### From Max

\(...from article\) Distributed governance is the specification of principles and methods which enable scalable coordination for forming consensus and to legitimate decisions. In such systems, all participants are treated equally without the presence of a central actor of hierarchy. They are scalable, so efficiency is not reduced but steady or increased by an increasing number of participants.

Challenge is how to maintain and implement changes in such an organization. As there’s no direct decision maker to manage and allocate resources, management in such structures is done through the process of signaling, proposing and distributed decision making.

> _Governance is the process of establishing and maintaining the legitimacy of decision making process –_ Vlad Zamfir

The governance itself consists of signaling, proposing, review and acceptance.  Examples of things to be governed:

* Community Values \(Monetary Policy, Censorship Resistance, “Code is law” immutability\)
* Brand, Trademark
* Protocol source code, access to software repositories

### From Tim: Values Convo

The Why?

Below are all the values we identify:

* Truth
* Immunity
* Sovereignty
* Functionality
* Highly-adaptable
* Anti-fragility
* Cohesion
* Rapture 
* Coherence
* Humility 
* Collaboration
* Inclusion
* Competence
* Trust

We developed two basic types of values - some were human centric, the others were systematical.

      <td style="text-align:left">
        <p>Yes, we are building a new system for the commons, which will challenge

</table>Distribution and decentralisation - you can see these systems in nature as well, hierarchies can be seen everywhere and should not be rejected per se. 

Chris: the end system will look like a hierarchy. We’re talking about distribution but these systems are nested in each other, overlapping constantly. The governance as distribution of power is all about how the overlapping functions, what are the patterns we can identify to achieve the values. 

Why distributed governance? Less captured then centred. 

#### **Value review and recaption**

Eliminating the ones we don’t feel fit so a strong core remains. 

There’s a lot of cohesion between the values and we might separate them a bit so we make a systematic pattern. 

We need to find out the minimal structure, minimal viable systems and minimal viable structure is that we need for the system to evolve. 

We already have some patterns - on one hand we have those that we all know and we need to find how we’re going to combine them, while on the other hand we have values that we don’t commonly recognise and need to start with the common understanding of them. 

When we have different cultural backgrounds it is difficult to kick start as a DAO, we do need a cohesion around the values. In every human based system there is a value story and a structure for governing how we rule. If we speak about ‘’code as a law’’ there is a bias perception. 

If we’re focusing on a structure there might be a danger lingering upon this that we forget why we’re doing it. 

Last 5 minutes: reading the questions and reflecting upon. 

We’re being capable of going from complexity while we can still open to some specific issues we need to address is something we need to take into consideration. It’s revealing for those who can contribute more with the knowledge they possess in other fields.
