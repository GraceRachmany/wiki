# Good Governance

## Structure of Work is Open, Transparent and Participative

1. Maintain the [strategy](./) / [governance](../foundation/roles/) up to date \(quarterly retro + strategy clarification\)
2. Setup the [newsletter](../newsletter/) report routine
3. [Industry Landscape](../dgov-industry-landscape/) and [Global Hubs](../resources/map-of-the-industry-landscape.md) directories are maintained
4. Interview more dgov stakeholders \(needs, expectations, strategies\)
5. Board of Advisors is gathered \(e.g. Aragon, DAO Stack, Colony\) / Meta calls?
