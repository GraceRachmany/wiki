# On-chain Governance Case Studies

[Discussion](https://daotalk.org/t/case-studies-decentralized-orgs-with-on-chain-governance/395)

## Introduction

We need to make a lot of experiments and thoroughly document them in order to find a working formula for the on-chain governance. This research is dedicated to collect, categorize and compare different attempts in governance automation and scaling with blockchain systems.

## Methodology

Structure of the report:

* Purpose
* History & key events
* Objects of governance \(e.g. repo, funds distribution\) & Used mechanics \(on-chain, off-chain\)
* Risk Management
* Network Stats
* Summary

## Layer 1: Network-based

### Tezos

#### Purpose

Tezos is a self-amending blockchain network which incorporates a formal, on-chain mechanism for proposing, selecting, testing, and activating protocol upgrades without the need to hard fork. Operates under liquid PoS consensus.

#### History & key events

* 2014 – Arthur Breitman and Kathleen Breitman, started developing Tezos with a core group of developers
* 2017 – $232 million ICO
* Feb 2018 – Dispute and Board reshuffle 
* Jun 2018 – Testnet launch
* Sep 2018 – Mainnet Launch

#### Objects of governance & Used mechanics

Upgrades to the protocol through proposal & voting process. Uses min quorum adapted to the average participation and and 80% of supermajority support level to pass.

* Developers independently submit proposals for protocol upgrades and request for compensation for their work.
* The request for compensation makes sure that the developers have a strong economic incentive to contribute to the ecosystem
* The proposal goes through a testing period wherein the community tests the protocol and criticizes it for possible improvements.
* After repeated testing, the Tezos token holders can then vote on whether the proposal should be approved or not.
* Once a legitimate upgrade is decided on, a “hot swap” occurs on the protocol, which initiates the new version of the protocol.

#### Risk Management

As a security measure, the Tezos foundation will have a veto power expiring after twelve months, until we rule out any kinks in the voting procedure.

#### Network Stats

* Market cap $0.79B
* 107 bakers on April 2019

#### Summary

* Results of current votings?

## Summary

Make statements about what blockchain governance is and how it realtes to onchain and offchain governance. E.g. On-chain governance – ability to change the protocol based on the on-chain events. No need in 100% on-chain, combination with off-chain is ok as well.
