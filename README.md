# Welcome to the \#dgov network

We connect people to discover practices, implement technical solutions and create complex, scalable governance systems that create cohesion and allow people to flourish. 

It's a pleasure to welcome you here :\)

### Also we have a couple of rules:

* Stay on topic: please post and discuss topics relevant to governance, DAO, token economy etc
* Give More Than You Take: What makes a community amazing is when members are more focused on helping each other, than on helping themselves. Be as helpful as possible and everyone benefits!
* No Hate Speech or Bullying: You should respectfully challenge ideas, but never attack the person. Help us make sure everyone feels safe in the community. Bullying of any kind isn't allowed, and degrading comments about things like race, religion, culture, sexual orientation, gender or identity will not be tolerated.
* We practice [do-acracy](https://earth.us18.list-manage.com/track/click?u=566b6b2a60e0829db656d3b34&id=b9d4ac1cc6&e=7265fe9357)
