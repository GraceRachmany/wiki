# Why DAO?

This first weekly call for all things dGov took place February 12, 2020, and we kicked off the conversation with the topic “Why DAO?” We did not take formal notes but anyone is welcome to add to this wiki.

DGOV connects people to discover practices, implement technical solutions and create complex, scalable governance systems that create cohesion and allow people to flourish.


## Ideas for next calls:

What is a DAO?

Who should be included in a DAO?

DAO vs. Oligarchy

Use cases and lessons learn

Equality vs. Expertise

Incentivization vs. Reputation currencies

Transparency

Transparency vs. Efficiency

Execution of decisions (what happens after the vote?)

Identity vs. Anonymity

The Tragedy of the Commons (false myth) and Free Rider problems

What are we deluding ourselves about

Money: Redistribution of Value

Money as Optionality

Failures and learnings

Trust versus trustless 

Rituals and ceremonies

Envisioning the end game

Envisioning the transition

When not to DAO

Ostrom’s principles: scaling of commoning

Best practices: 

Idea Exchange: Sharing our projects and getting feedback from others

Territory/Land/ Sovereignty

What is a commons and what should be a commons

Here’s a pretty relevant article about DAOs: https://medium.com/@ivanthinking/the-human-side-of-daos-ca6f2e729a82

@Fernando: if it’s a scaled cooperative, why not just have a cooperative?

From andreasarnold to Everyone:  02:27 PM

Rather than „scaled“, maybe „multiplied to other places“.

From Manuela Bosch to Everyone:  02:27 PM

I like to share a resource/method with you, that integrates ancient practices/wisdom when building distributed/self-organized projects https://dragondreaming.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/DragonDreaming_eBook_english_V02.09.pdf

From Lauren Nignon to Everyone:  02:28 PM

Thanks, @Manela. I really appreciate the resource.

From ManuAlzuru to Everyone:  02:29 PM

Digital Organizations

From Michal to Everyone:  02:30 PM

+1 to digital orgs, or orgs in the digital age

From ManuAlzuru to Everyone:  02:38 PM

DAOs = Multisig

Currently :)

Why DAO?

What is a DAO?

When not to DAO?

From Lauren Nignon to Everyone:  02:41 PM

Eyal: Multi-sig is a huge deal

From Ruben Russel to Everyone:  02:42 PM

DAO’s = humans + multi-sig

From Michal to Everyone:  02:44 PM

"we're more closed than when we were activists!! Now we're activists who're using a technology no one understands (...)  let's deal with adoption first!"

From Lauren Nignon to Everyone:  02:45 PM

I have found that transparency is very difficult when dealing with mental health issues, which come up often in this neuro-atypical DAO space

From Eyal to Everyone:  02:46 PM

Can DAOs Save Politics: my personal experience in a political movement, and how DAOs could have saved it from collapsing:

From Michal to Everyone:  02:46 PM

@Fernando --- people behave differently when they or their actions are constantly observed

From Eyal to Everyone:  02:48 PM

And here is a Democracy DAO spec, trying to understand issues like transparency, structure of organization, adoption, and others: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rbfqgPCm0SJyXP48tundjfSpfSReu7vMtIydTszeMzE/edit#heading=h.7rhxtwmmig9v

All comments on the both pieces would be great

From Manuela Bosch to Everyone:  02:49 PM

Thank you, Eyal!

From Michal to Everyone:  02:52 PM

Are we impatient?
