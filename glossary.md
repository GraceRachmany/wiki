### Ideology

A collection of [normative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normative) [beliefs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beliefs) and [values](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Values) that an individual or group holds for other than purely [epistemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistemic) reasons.[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideology#cite_note-1)

### Social movement

A large, sometimes informal, groupings of [individuals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Individual) or [organizations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organization) which focus on specific [political](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics) or [social issues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_issue). \[[source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_movement)\] 

Loosely organized but sustained campaign in support of a social goal, typically either the implementation or the prevention of a change in society’s structure or values. Collective behaviour in crowds, panics, and elementary forms \(milling, etc.\) are of brief duration or episodic and are guided largely by impulse. When short-lived impulses give way to long-term aims, and when sustained association takes the place of situational groupings of people, the result is a social movement. \[[source](https://www.britannica.com/topic/social-movement)\]

Movement is a network of informal interactions between a plurality of individuals, groups and/or organizations, engaged in a political or cultural conflict, on the basis of a shared collective identity. \[[source](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227630891_The_Concept_of_Social_Movement)\]

### Network

Type of organization focused on connecting members for collaboration, opportunities exchange \(projects, sales\), hiring etc. 

Personal Networks – e.g., alumni, professional, social and affinity groups — these allow you to meet a diverse group of like-minded professionals. Good for career moves, and to link you to new kinds of networks for your current work when opportunities emerge there. \[[source](https://100trillion.wordpress.com/2008/06/21/three-types-of-professional-networks/)\]

### Community

A community is a small or large social unit \(a group of living things\) that has something in common, such as norms, religion, values, or identity. Communities often share a sense of place that is situated in a given geographical area \(e.g. a country, village, town, or neighborhood\) or in virtual space through communication platforms. \[[source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community)\]

In Gemeinschaft und Gesellschaft \(1887\), German sociologist [Ferdinand Tönnies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferdinand_T%C3%B6nnies) described two types of human association: Gemeinschaft \(usually translated as "community"\) and Gesellschaft \("society" or "association"\). Tönnies proposed the Gemeinschaft–Gesellschaft [dichotomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dichotomy) as a way to think about social ties. No group is exclusively one or the other. Gemeinschaft stress personal [social interactions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_interaction), and the roles, values, and beliefs based on such interactions. Gesellschaft stress indirect interactions, impersonal roles, formal values, and beliefs based on such interactions.[\[6\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community#cite_note-6)
