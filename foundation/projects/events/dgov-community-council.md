## About

The event will stretch over two full days in a co-creative, open space environment concluding with a dinner gathering for the participants on the first evening. After the opening sessions we will have an open space and facilitators helping us design the working circles. We will continue with the working circles in the morning of the second day. In the afternoon, we will openly share our learnings and insights in a public meetup format with fishbowl-debates.

You will be among a maximum of forty participants to gather with the intention to create governance models which take a human centric, horizontal approach to the management of shared-resources. We foster a community of participants which have an inherent interest in collaboration to exchange research and learnings to support their own projects while accelerating the innovation on distributed governance models.

## Supporters

This event is supported by the Tezos Foundation with the lead researcher Jacob Arluck. Primavera de Filippi and Constance Choi along with other Coalas will join us as well.

Experienced Facilitators like Phoebe Tickell from Percolab and the Enspiral Network will help us design and facilitate the experience. Special thanks to Gnosis for providing the Full Node
