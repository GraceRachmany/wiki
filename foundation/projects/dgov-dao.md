# Dgov DAO

Leader: Tim/Liraz? + 19 people on the telegram group

The DAO itself is believe to be nothing else than an intermediate step of exploration to support the DGOV Community with blockchain based infrastructure for coordination. This creates space\(s\) for exploration of new governance models.

The first seed DAO acts as in incubator to spawn many other independent second generation “child DAO’s” which spawn third generation “child DAO’s” ...and so on to allow for concurrent iterations. The number of child-DAO’s or newly created DAO’s based on iterations of the first template should be arbitrary.
