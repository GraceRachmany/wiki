## Format

DGOV Assembly Paris is a one-day event in a co-creative, open space environment \(an open space conference is a participant-driven process whose agenda is created by people attending\).

After the opening sessions, we will have an open space and facilitators helping us design the working circles. We will close the day with a fishbowl session in order to openly share our learnings and insights in a public meetup format.

You will be among a maximum of fifty participants to gather with the intention to create governance models which take a human-centric approach to the management of shared resources.

We foster a community of participants which have an inherent interest in collaboration to exchange research and learnings to support their own projects while accelerating the innovation on distributed governance models.

To be more specific, we look forward to:

* Share why we care \(Values\)
* Gather requirements for distributed governance systems
* Identify new projects and strengthen existing projects
* Exchange of research and experiences
* Build up cross-platform and cross-project collaborations
* Identification of new innovation spaces
* Map out the community
  * Individual profiles on a volunteering basis
  * Project profiles
* Building a strong network of individuals to increase quality and speed on distributed governance research with practical implementation approaches and real-world experimentation

## Vision

We operate under the constraints that the governance models we seek to create are fit for a sustainable future where everybody is self-empowered to take agency in political participatory processes to wisely manage limited shared resources.

We seek governance models to support and enable massive horizontal coordination required to outperform existing governance models, as well as providing a suitable coordination structure for network societies.

## Goals

The Distributed Governance Assembly Paris aims to connect you with other minds who believe in our chance to reinvent governance. New governance models are urgently needed to allow us to coordinate and manage shared-resources on a global scale. This includes permissionless blockchains to provide a virtual territory for building commonly owned infrastructure outside the domain of corporations and governments which are resistant to capture.

We want to embrace the following guiding principles:

### 1. Building Commons

In an open and transparent fashion, our work can enable innovation. We openly share our documented experiences. The knowledge \(incl. software and systems\) we gain is open sourced. We acknowledge the necessity for open source developed platforms with the purpose to serve as a trusted community owned and community governed infrastructure.

> “In real open source, you have the right to control your own destiny.“ - Linus Torvalds

### 2. Collaboration

Allowing us to share perspectives with the assertion that we all have a limited ability to understand the infinite complexity of this world on our own. Grasping diversity and sharing different perspectives without the need to judge for “right or wrong” improves our collaboration.

> "The test of a first-rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in mind at the same time and still retain the ability to function." - F. Scott Fitzgerald.

### 3. Win-Win instead of Win-Lose

We believe in a future where we favour collaboration over rival risk behaviour. A future where we take responsibility for becoming stewards of those limited shared resources \(community owned and governed\).

> “It's not those with the most competitive advantage that makes it through in the long run, but the most self-stabilizing ecosystems.” - Daniel Schmachtenberger

### 4. Tapping into collective intelligence and wisdom

While creating an environment of trust and compassion, we provide the ground for a collaboration where we achieve what seems impossible. Only if we feel cared for, we become vulnerable and start speaking about what we truly feel - tapping into emotional intelligence which is required for making collective decisions. Caring enables us to be aware and with it represent the needs of those who can’t speak for themselves or which might be Underrepresented.

> "In the course of history, there comes a time when humanity is called upon to shift to a new level of consciousness, to reach a higher moral ground." - Wangari Maathai

### 5. Systemic solutions to systemic problems

Our current society systems externalize costs and harm in a psychopathic way which can only result in self-termination. Therefore there is a strong need for us to build societal structures which create antifragile, self-stabilising emerging patterns. which internalise costs.

## Who

A small team of volunteers, namely Tim Bansemer, Anja Blaj, Max Semenchuk, worked together since May 2018 towards the realisation of a Distributed Governance Conference and the inception of the DGOV Foundation.

As a follow up to the DGOV Council who took place in Berlin in January 2019, a team of volunteers based out of Paris, France, took up the initiative of organizing a second DGOV open conference in the context of EthCC and the Community Blockchain Week Paris. The team is made up of Anuj Dasgupta, Louis Giraux, Philippe Honigman, actively supported by Tim, Max, and Phoebe Tickell.
