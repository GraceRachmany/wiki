## **Strategy \(how\)**

### **Build connectivity / a network**

The goal of the DGOV Foundation is to create a highly-potent group of approximate 150 people which are bond together in a vision and by a culture allowing them to build and implement distributed governance models.

* Maximum integratable cognitive diversity
* Omni-considerative / omni-win decision making
