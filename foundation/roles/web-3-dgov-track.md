# Web 3 dgov track

### **Hosting a spot in the HackerNode Space**

The HackerNode is a huge room that will be divided among 8-10 Nodes doing different programming \(Workshops, Talks, Panels, Games, Hacks\) and this space will be available 24 hours a day \(not that you have to use it all 24 hours!\).  I think this is the most interactive way to engage and have impact at the Summit. That being said, you’d have to be willing to plan 2.5-3 days \(assuming Wednesday may be a lighter day\) of content. You’d have mostly free reign to do what you want and get creative.  


Schedule:

* Talks
* Presentations
* Lightning talks / demos
* Discussions
* Workshops

Conf schedule \(old\)
