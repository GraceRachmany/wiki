## Project Updates

* Work until 4:00 pm CET
* Coordination \(Max\) – newsletter delayed, Barcelona meetup. London meetup: open-coop was great, looked a lot like dgov event, some blockchain people were there \(colony, holochain, aragon\), got feedback on the seed dao. Was good to see where we're heading. People were curious, had more people joined. Was a strong backslash against blockchain from people from other industries.
* Research and share knowledge \(Max\) – talked with giveth gov labs to build collab research work
* Experimentation & Incubation \(Max\) – dao crash test 3 happened
* Implementation & Regulation \(Anja\) – we have lot's of jurisdictions, working on the info what legal forms / jurisdictions we have for DAOs, working on the web3 track
* Retreat in Ljubljana \(Anja\) – Matei in contact with the agency. Adam should have come to Slovenia for eco-villages, recognized we can be partners, can have discussion about dgov. Maybe retreat in the eco-village, maybe unlikely. Trouble with the dates – need a new doodle with weekdays.
* Funding with Seed DAO \(Tim\) – know the parties who can fund, important to do in 2 stages. Need a stronger focused person first, to start the paperwork, lobbying etc. Speaking with Ela. Invite the ideas about the funding
* Web 3 track \(Max\) – feels on track, doing more detailed program announcement soon

## Tensions

### Max / Devcon node

Everybody likes the idea

Need help with getting in touch with Lane

### Anja / Dates for Ljubljana

How do you feel about another doodle? Appropriate to come during the week?

* Tim: during the week more complicated to relax and not to do work. Another thing – we're loosing a lot of time by finding the ideal time for all. But if you like to prio – would love to see Martin there
* Ela: do we have a preferred date at all? \(yes 20-21-22\) So arrival on Thu 19th? \(yes\) and Sunday - half day?
* Max: support what Tim said
* Phoebe: as well. Surprised about the speed. Too many projects on Aeon? Maybe we can help unblocking. Priority is the good retreat \(minimum viable team\)
* Tim: maybe we need to change based on location.

### Ela / Potential tasks \(fundraising\)

Had conversation with all of you, 2 things important. Felt a certain reservation about the task about community building for 1-2 people. Our project needs distributed responsibility. We can distribute in accordance with skills / preferences. Feel doubt about 1 paid position / sustainable work for everyone. Maybe smaller projects inside the team. Current status of works and responsibilities. Entire community building task was assigned to Tim \(in wiki\). Probably some kind of burden. The outtake from open-coop, 3 pillars:

* facilitating community communication \(chat\)
* creating information flows \(max - newsletter, research papers\)
* building processes inside the community \(e.g. raising funds for the research paper\) – where's the project folder, how we can help setup.

Was thinking about specific formats, e.g. beweekly community call on zoom. Done with RChain, like the format. Another idea – rotating moderation in telegram. Helping build processes to store information online. Would be ready to help with those tasks. Also finding the sustainability for the team in terms of funding.

Also Andreas could be super interested to help with incoming tasks \(like event organization\). We love to do that. What you think about that?

Questions:

* Any chance to look into Seed DAO Paper – no, haven't read

Feedback:

* Anja: support that. Every time somebody asks – there's a bunch of ways to describe it. If anybody want to do smth – its supported. We need to find the mutual idea. Like that Ela has a strategic mindset. Hearing about the handbook – really liked it.
* Phoebe: happy having you, enjoy hearing your suggestions. Good ideas. DAO Stack, Enspiral, Capra Course community – there're patterns / best practices. Also in-person meetings. Lack of funds stopped us before. Would be less barrier. Missing layer of how we govern the community. Strategy and funding are needed. Allows us to make choice about who will do the work. 3 things: governance, funding and strategy. It's easy to contribute fo free when you the infrastrcuture
* Ela: could be different layers on engagement. It's totally aligned, increased visibility. We could also start from minor sources.
* Max: really welcome your contribution, good to be added on the strategy file. let's rock it.
* Tim: have frustration, don't think that fundraising is difficult. I can do that very good, can identify the needed people. We have a potent team to receive large amounts of funding. What was missing – opportunity to close the funding. Another part of frustration – we now organize in holacracy, have some processes etc. My hope is we start working on how we scale, need a catalyst. For me it's the core people. Need some institutionalization. Without a separate legal entity. Want to show it's possible. Would love to ficus on that area. Don't want to keep in the responsibility. Need to clean up the proposal, need somebody driving that. Have a person of contact, committed person. How we can solidify.

Ela: What it takes to fund the seed dao? Plan? \(yes\) Roadmap rather than strategy map?

Tim: Both – network and plan. All soft governance aspects don't need to be specified, need a multisig first and partner contracts. dgov as a project.

### Anja / Onboarding people

### Phoebe / Handbook on dgov \(decision making, onboarding, offboarding etc\)

### Anja / Addressing the skeptics
