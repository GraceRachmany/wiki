## Project Updates

* Work until 4:00 pm CET
* Coordination \(Max\) – Anja did a meetup at Carribean
* Research and share knowledge \(Max\) – no update
* Experimentation & Incubation \(Max\) – no update
* Implementation & Regulation \(Anja\) – Tim will participate in the DAO workshop, have the DAO principles doc
* Retreat in Ljubljana \(Tim\) – expected Maria and Anja to come up with locations, but no news there, no capacity to push it forward. Will ping
* Funding with Seed DAO \(Tim\) – have a point on that to discuss. There's some backlog on the marketing. Had a conversation with Decred and Colony, they and other players have tools they can provide. Very interesting opportunity is to be interdisciplinary network, but we need to finalize funding. Next step – work through solution providers, have professional knowledge about solutions. Requires attention.
* Web 3 track \(Max\) – we have some speakers \(~30% agenda ready\), have some collusion with DAO stack event. 2 weeks before read
  * Day 1 \(Tim\)
  * Day 2 \(Max\)
  * Day 3 \(Phoebe\)
